# interprocess-communication

This is a program that demonstrates the basics of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using shared memory, message queues, and semaphores. The purpose of this program is to help the author better understand how IPC works and improve their coding skills. 

This program has been "forked" from an Assignment about IPC from the course "System Level Programming" at TU Graz and most of the code has been written by the author themselves. However, some small parts have been adapted or copied over from the Assignment Framework.

This program provides a simple example of how multiple processes can communicate with each other using shared memory, message queues, and semaphores. It includes a client and a server process that can send and receive messages through shared memory and message queues, as well as synchronize access to shared resources using semaphores.

This program is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for production or mission-critical applications. <br \>
